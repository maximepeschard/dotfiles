#
# This tmux script creates a new session with the name entered by the user at
# the prompt.
# Two windows are created :
# - the first is the "IDE", with a main editor pane and two bottom panes
#   (eg. for file management, REPL, build tools...)
# - the second one with a default top htop pane and an empty bottom one
